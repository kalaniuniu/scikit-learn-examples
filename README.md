#Introduction
Hi,everyone. 

This is my first project in github. Just for fun. This repository will share all the scikit learn examples on the web site of the scikit-learn.org. the web site is here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html.


Let's learn machine learning together!


#General Examples
1.plotting Cross-Validated predictions
2.Concatenating multiple feature extraction methods
3.pipelining:chaining a PCA and a logistic regression
4.isotonic regression
5.imputing missing values before building an estimator
6.face completion with a multi-output estimators
7.selecting dimensionality reduction with pipeline and gridsearchCV
8.multilabel classification
9.the Johnson-Lindenstrauss bound for embedding with random projections
10.commparsion of kernel ridge regression and SVR
11.feature union with heterogeneous data sources.
12.explicit feature map approximation for RBF kernels.
